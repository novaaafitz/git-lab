Answer 3:
    When you type "git --help", it displays an explanation of common Git commands used in different situations, as well as a description of use cases. For example, to start a working area, it suggests you use the clone command, or the init command. It also explains what each of those commands do. Clone clones a repository into a new directory, and init creates an empty Git repository or re-initializes an existing one. There are several more common Git command descriptions here, including commands to work on current changes, examine history and state, grow, mark, and tweak your common history, and collaborate. It seems pretty helpful to reference when you need to work in a collaborative environment, or anytime you use version control with Git.
